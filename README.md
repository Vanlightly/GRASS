# GRASS
GRaph of the Architecture of Systems and Servers

This is currently an in house project that reads config files and code files to build a graph of the thousands componenets that make up the architecture of the whole software system.

## Query Generator
Proof-of-concept Cypher query generator that helps users write Cypher queries and execute them in the Neo4J console.
It is just a proof-of-concept written in a static Html, Js and CSS files. It represents an example of how you can model you software system and is really just an example.

I have removed many examples that were specific to my company's model, what remains are generic examples only. There are plenty more queries that can be written.
